# How to accurately value property
## Definition
Property valuation, also known as property appraisal, is the process of determining the economic worth of a property at a specific point in time. In Nigeria, this process is crucial for various purposes, including sales, purchases, mortgages, taxation, insurance, and investment decisions. This technical guide outlines the common methods employed for property valuation in Nigeria, emphasizing key considerations and providing illustrative examples.
### Problem
 Without a dependable way to assess a property's true value, financial institutions face a high risk of loan defaults. Overvalued properties can lead to excessive lending, while undervalued properties limit the amount of financing available. This uncertainty discourages both local and foreign investors from participating in the real estate sector, which is a major driver of economic growth.
 #### Tools
 Valuation professionals use a mix of traditional methods and modern technological tools to assess property value. The choice of tool depends on the type of property, its purpose, and the available data. This includes laser measuring devices, Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), smartphones with LiDAR scanners, and floor plan apps like CubiCasa that can automatically generate blueprints and square footage calculations.

##### Sales Comparison Approach (Market Approach)
This is the most widely used method for valuing residential properties and land. It involves comparing the subject property with recently sold similar properties (comparable) in the same or a comparable location. Adjustments are made to the sale prices of the comparable to account for differences in characteristics such as size, age, condition, features, and location.
###### Steps Involved:

1.	Identify Comparable Properties: Gather data on recent sales of properties that are similar to the subject property in terms of type, size, location, and other relevant characteristics. Data sources include real estate agents, online property portals, land registries, and valuation databases. Example: Suppose you are valuing a 3-bedroom bungalow in Lekki, Lagos. You would look for recent sales of similar 3-bedroom bungalows in the same or nearby estates in Lekki.
a.	Verify Sales Data: Confirm the accuracy of the sales information, including the actual sale price, date of sale, and the terms and conditions of the transaction.
2.	Analyze Comparable Properties: Examine the features and characteristics of the comparable properties in detail.
3.	Make Adjustments: Identify differences between the subject property and each comparable and make appropriate monetary or percentage adjustments to the sale prices of the comparables. Adjustments may be made for factors like:
o	Size: Differences in land area, floor area, and number of rooms.
o	Condition: Differences in the physical state of repair and maintenance.
o	Features: Differences in amenities such as parking, security, swimming pool, and finishes.
o	Location: Differences in neighborhood desirability, proximity to amenities, and accessibility.
o	Time of Sale: Adjustments for market changes that have occurred since the comparable property was sold.
Example of Adjustment: If a comparable property sold for N50 million but has a slightly larger land size than the subject property, a downward adjustment would be made to its sale price to reflect this difference.
4.	Reconcile Adjusted Values: After making adjustments to several comparables, reconcile the adjusted sale prices to arrive at an estimated value range for the subject property. A weighted average may be used, giving more weight to the most similar and reliable comparables.
