# How to accurately value property
## Definition
Property valuation, also known as property appraisal, is the process of determining the economic worth of a property at a specific point in time. In Nigeria, this process is crucial for various purposes, including sales, purchases, mortgages, taxation, insurance, and investment decisions. This technical guide outlines the common methods employed for property valuation in Nigeria, emphasizing key considerations and providing illustrative examples.
### Problem
 Without a dependable way to assess a property's true value, financial institutions face a high risk of loan defaults. Overvalued properties can lead to excessive lending, while undervalued properties limit the amount of financing available. This uncertainty discourages both local and foreign investors from participating in the real estate sector, which is a major driver of economic growth.
 #### Tools
 Valuation professionals use a mix of traditional methods and modern technological tools to assess property value. The choice of tool depends on the type of property, its purpose, and the available data. This includes laser measuring devices, Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), smartphones with LiDAR scanners, and floor plan apps like CubiCasa that can automatically generate blueprints and square footage calculations.
